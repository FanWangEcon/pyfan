``pyfan`` is a work-in-progress `package <https://pypi.org/project/pyfan/>`__ consisting of various python support
functions for various research related-tasks. This is a part of the `pyfan <https://github.com/fanwangecon/pyfan>`__
repository, which has two components:

1. The `pyfan tutorial <https://fanwangecon.github.io/pyfan/bookdown/>`__
   `book <https://fanwangecon.github.io/pyfan/bookdown/>`__ and
   `reference site <https://fanwangecon.github.io/pyfan/>`__, which is built with Rmd files and bookdown.
2. The `pyfan Package <https://pypi.org/project/pyfan/>`__, which has this sphinx based documentation
   and tutorials to test and demonstrate package functions.

Materials are gathered from various `projects <https://fanwangecon.github.io/research>`__ in which python code is used
for research and paper-administrative tasks.  In addition, the `pyecon <https://github.com/FanWangEcon/pyecon>`__ repository
and the associated `package <https://pyfan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__  contain functions for solving dynamic heterogeneous
agents models.
