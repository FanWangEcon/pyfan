``pyfan`` is a work-in-progress `package <https://pypi.org/project/pyfan/>`_ consisting of various python support
functions for various research related-tasks. This is a part of the `pyfan <https://github.com/fanwangecon/pyfan>`_
repository, which has two components:

1. The based `pyfan <https://fanwangecon.github.io/pyfan/bookdown/>`_ python tutorial
   `book <https://fanwangecon.github.io/pyfan/bookdown/>`_ and
   `reference site <https://fanwangecon.github.io/pyfan/>`_, which is built with Rmd files and bookdown.
2. The `pyfan <https://pypi.org/project/pyfan/>`_ Python Package, which has this sphinx based documentation
   and tutorials to test and demonstrate package functions.

Materials are gathered from various `projects <https://fanwangecon.github.io/research>`_ in which python code is used
for research and paper-administrative tasks.  In addition, the `pyecon <https://github.com/FanWangEcon/pyecon>`_ repository
and the associated `package <https://pyfan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_  contain functions for solving dynamic heterogeneous
agents models.
