This is a work-in-progress [website](https://fanwangecon.github.io/pyfan/) consisting of python tutorials and examples to accomplish. Files are written with [RMD](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) [@R-rmarkdown]. Materials are gathered from various [projects](https://fanwangecon.github.io/research) in which python code is used for research and paper-administrative tasks. Files are from [**Fan**](https://fanwangecon.github.io/)'s [pyfan](https://github.com/FanWangEcon/pyfan) repository which has an associated [package](https://pypi.org/project/pyfan/). The package functionalize various tasks tested out in the Rmd files. In addition, the [pyecon](https://github.com/FanWangEcon/pyecon) repository and the associated [package](https://pypi.org/project/pyecon/) ([readthedocs](https://pyfan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/pyfan/index.html#module-pyfan)) contain functions and rmd files related explicitly to solving economic models.
